An extensive throughput performance evaluation on basis of Packet transmission longer than threshold according to RTS/CTS mechanism in 802.11. 
In the 802.11 protocol, the fundamental mechanism to access the medium is called distributed coordination function (DCF).This is a random access scheme, based on the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. Retransmission of collided packets is managed according to binary exponential backoff rules. Before transmitting a packet, a station operating in RTS/CTS mode “reserves” the channel by sending a special Request-To-Send short frame.The destination station acknowledges the receipt of an RTS frame by sending back a Clear-To-Send frame, after which normal packet transmission and ACK response occurs. Since collision may occur only on the RTS frame, and it is detected by the lack of CTS response, the RTS/CTS mechanism allows to increase the system performance by reducing the duration of a collision when long messages are transmitted. So, we evaluate the performance by calculating throughput taking following points into consideration, 1. Taking 2 nodes at distance of 100m in Grid form 2. Taking 3 nodes at the same distance 3. Increasing distance from 100m to 290m and checking hidden terminal problem 4. By enabling RTS/CTS by setting threshold value less than packet size.
